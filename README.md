## Title of Project
  Game Reviewer

## How the site works
  Game Reviewer uses js , html and uses the node.js enviornment for its backend endpoints. The backend was documented with swagger. Also an external API was used called RAWG API (https://rawg.io/apidocs) to help get game informaiton that is used. The site will also be deployed to the cloud using render https://render.com/ .

## Our goal
  The goal of our project was to create an interactive platform that allows people to view and create their own reviews for games. With these reviews, people could discover new games they may be interested in.

## How to test our project locally on your machine?
1.First download all code and files from the repossitory.

2.Then in your console, type npm install

3.Then start the server by typing node index.js (alternativly if you have nodemon installed, you can type nodemon index.js)

4.Congrats! you should see a notification in your console that the server is listening at port 5678. 

Now go http://localhost:5678/ and the game reviewer should popup.

## View swagger information
  To view the endpoints, simply go to  http://localhost:5678/api-docs/  while the server is running to view the endpoints.
